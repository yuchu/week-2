    # Lab 1, Part 5 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    /* =====================

    Start code

    ===================== */

    /* Problem: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
    The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. */
    sum = 0;
    for (var i = 1; i < 1000; i++){
      if ((i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0)){
        sum += i
      };
    };
    console.log(sum)

    /* =====================

    End code
